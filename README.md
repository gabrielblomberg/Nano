# UAVP03Nano

Arduino C source code for the UAV Flight Data Recorder (FDR) as part of ENGG1200 at the University of Queensland, 2019 Semester 2. Team P03 Nano. The FDR was meant to be attached to a self designed fixed wing UAV, that was launched from from a slingshot. The accelerational data was to be sent to a base station, and the flight time of the UAV displayed on LEDs in binary upon landing. The FDR was composed of a custom provided PCB with a Arduino Pro Mini. An MPU6050 accelerometer and RF24 transceiver were used.
