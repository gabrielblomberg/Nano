Arduino C source code for the UAV Flight Data Recorder (FDR) as part of ENGG1200 at the University of Queensland, 2019 Semester 2. Team P03 Nano. The FDR was composed of a custom provided PCB with a Arduino Pro Mini. An MPU6050 accelerometer and RF24 transceiver were used to collect acclerational data, and transmit this to a base station.
