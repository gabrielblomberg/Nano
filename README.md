# Nano

Arduino C source code for the UAV Flight Data Recorder (FDR) as part of the ENGG1200 design project at the University of Queensland, 2019 Semester 2. Team P03 Nano. The FDR was attached to a team designed fixed wing UAV, that was launched from a slingshot. The accelerational data was to be sent to a base station to be used to calculate final flight distance (acting like a basic inertial measurement unit), and the flight time of the UAV displayed on LEDs in binary upon landing. The FDR was composed of a custom provided PCB with a Arduino Pro Mini. An MPU6050 accelerometer and RF24 transceiver were used to record and transmit acceleration.
